      <p>The prime objective of the association is to promote Social work profession and to help and facilitate the
        students of social work in their internships, training, job placement and research work. In recent past premier
        institutions and different social work departments of the State and Central universities have done very hard
        works to give recognition to social work profession and still the efforts are going on. At other hand a large
        number of non government organization (NGOs) are working in State and involved in implementation of Government
        schemes. These NGOs needs to be trained with technical knowledge and techniques of social work profession. As a
        State level association of Social work professional we will closely work with different Government departments
        to ensure the role of Social work profession either through training, Job placements or technical support to
        their scheme implementing partners. Indeed our Alumni of different social work departments are also working in
        different fields and playing a important role and can help the fresher for their jobs, we will also provide
        Financial and logistics supports to social work department and to organize and reorganize their Alumni and
        ensure their regular annual meetings. Finally, I request all my respected Teachers, Friends, Colleagues and
        students to join this association as a member to achieve its objectives and give a new strength and direction to
        social work profession and ensure better future of our coming generation.</p>
